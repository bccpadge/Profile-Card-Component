## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned you can apply multiple images using url on background image property in CSS.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
body {
  background-image: url('/images/bg-pattern-top.svg'), url('/images/bg-pattern-bottom.svg');
}
```


### Continued development

I will definitely continue doing the mobile-first worklflow. Personally, it easier to start mobile-first and you always look at the layout of the desktop and compare the designs that way. Some people do desktop approach which is fine. I find desktop approach much harder than the mobile-first workflow.
